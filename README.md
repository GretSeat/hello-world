# hello-world
This is my first[^1] repository, following the GitHub Quickstart Guide

[^1]: My *first* repository was actually made, and promptly deleted a few weeks ago, because I didn't know what I was doing, and for some reason I thought to myself "I don't want that on my GitHub". I guess I'm a perfectionist in that sense, but I didn't want anyone being able to critisize what I had done.
