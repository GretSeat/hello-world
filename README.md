**GretSeat's First Repository**
## This is my first[^1] repository, following the GitHub Quickstart Guide.

I enjoy that it walked me through how to properly make a repository, and push my first commits, branches, and pull requests. What I'm currently writing now is just some random stuff to play with the mark up, and various other things.

[^1]: My *first* repository was actually made, and promptly deleted a few weeks ago, because I didn't know what I was doing, and for some reason I thought to myself "I don't want that on my GitHub". I guess I'm a perfectionist in that sense, but I didn't want anyone being able to critisize what I had done. 

This is to see what kind of formatting can be done.
